# Real-Time Embedding & Retrieval Error Scanner

A lightweight, plug-and-play ML microservice that detects **embedding drift, semantic retrieval failures, and degraded search quality** in real-time for RAG and semantic search systems.

This tool is designed for **ML Engineers and MLOps teams** to debug silent failures in production embedding-based systems.
